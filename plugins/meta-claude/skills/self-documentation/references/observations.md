# Observations

User-discovered behaviors and findings not documented in official Claude Code documentation. These observations come from hands-on testing and community contributions.

**Note**: Some observations may later be confirmed by SDK documentation. When this happens, the observation is migrated to `sdk-behavioral-bridges.md` with proper attribution.

**How to contribute**: When you discover undocumented behavior, use this skill to record it. The skill will create a GitHub issue and optionally cache locally.

## How to Add Observations

When you discover something undocumented about Claude Code:

1. Describe the observation clearly
2. Note when and how you discovered it
3. Explain the practical implication
4. Identify the feature area (Tools, Subagents, Skills, Hooks, etc.)

The skill will help you format and submit this as a GitHub issue for tracking.
